### `To start kindly run`


### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it.  

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
# or
yarn start --reset-cache
```

#### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on the tests.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open the app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open the app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup). it is recommended to install Genymotion as your Android emulator.
